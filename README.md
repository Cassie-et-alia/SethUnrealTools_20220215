Seth's Unreal Tools as of 02/15/2022

Thanks for using my tools! 

Contains a Utility for changing asset paths:
BPU_AssetPathUpdater_v3.0


#~~~~BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW TO SET IT UP~~~~#

Step 1: Download "SethsUnrealTools_20220215_ue4"

Step 2: Open your existing project or make a new one.

Step 3: Activate two plugins: "Python Editor Scripting" & "Editor Scripting Utilities"
		#Unreal will want you to Restart, but just close your project for the next step.

Step 4: In your explorer go into "SethsUnrealTools_20220215_ue4" project folder	> Content folder
		and copy the "Python" folder. Paste it in your project's "Content" folder.

Step 5: Open the project "SethsUnrealTools_20220215_ue4". Locate "BPU_AssetPathUpdater" and migrate it to your project.

Step6: Now open your project and right click on "BPU_AssetPathUpdater", select Run.

***NOTE***
As of AssetPathUpdater Version3, it only works on Static Meshes at this time. I will be adding more Assets in the future. 

Also, it does not actually relocate your static meshes, it simply tells Unreal where to look for them.
